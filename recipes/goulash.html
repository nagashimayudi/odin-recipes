        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This slow cooker Hungarian-style goulash is a very rich and flavorful beef dish with a thick, red and smoky-tasting sauce. <br>Great for making a day ahead and reheating. Instead of noodles, you can serve over rice, or potatoes.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 onions, sliced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>¼ cup smoked Spanish paprika</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 pounds lean beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
                <li>½ cup sour cream (Optional)</li>
                <li>8 sprigs fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions until they soften and begin to brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. <br>Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a slow cooker. Cover and set cooker to Low heat. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                    <p>Mix together paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Toss meat cubes in the paprika mixture until evenly coated.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                    <p>Heat one tablespoon of the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Put a third of the beef cubes into the skillet and cook until nicely browned on all sides. <br>Transfer to the slow cooker. Pour 2 tablespoons of water into the skillet and scrape browned bits from the pan; pour liquid into the slow cooker. <br>This prevents paprika from burning when you brown next batches of beef. Add another tablespoon of oil to the skillet and cook next batch the same way; repeat for third batch. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                    <p>Stir tomato paste and the rest of water into the slow cooker; cover. Cook on High for 4 to 5 hours (or on Low for 6 to 9 hours).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in egg noodles and cook uncovered, occasionally stirring, <br>until noodles have cooked through, but are still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                    <p>Serve goulash over noodles with a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of parsley.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
